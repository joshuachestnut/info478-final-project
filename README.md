# Food Insecurity in the United States

Joshua Chestnut, Feven Gurmu, Alex Kim, Aditya Ramani

## Project Description

__What is the purpose of your research project?__

There are several relationships we can observe between food access, stress, chronic diseases, and socioeconomic status. There are vulnerable populations such as low-income individuals who have limited access to low-cost and nutritious food which further contributes to the impediment of their health. Throughout our research, we hope to discover which states are more prone to experiencing food insecurity in addition to examining the various factors that limit access to healthy foods.

__What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to include 3+ links to related works.__

Research in this area has primarily been in the area of welfare, relating food insecurity to the wealth/socioeconomic status of families. Other studies have been done explaining how food insecurity leads to worse nutrition overall, and how food insecurity as a child can lead to a problem in the future with that child’s “Workforce and Job Readiness.”

__What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.__

For this project, we are utilizing a dataset that was constructed by _Feeding America_. _Feeding America_ is a nonprofit organization within the United States that has more than 200 food banks, and feeds more than 46 million people.

The food insecurity rates of the data set determined by “using data from the 2001-2017 Current Population Survey on individuals in food insecure households; data from the 2017 American Community Survey on median household incomes, poverty rates, homeownership, and race and ethnic demographics; and 2017 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on unemployment rate” (Map the Meal Gap 2019).

We acquired the data set by contacting _Feeding America_. Since we are using the information for an academic project, they were more than happy to share the data set with us.

Both the raw and prepped data has already been put into the repository.

__Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.__

Our target audience will be policy makers and government health workers who can influence decision making. Through our finding, we hope to illustrate how vulnerable populations are affected by different factors and suggest solutions.

__What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)__

What factors lead individuals to experience food insecurity?

What are some of the negative health outcomes related to food insecurity?

Which populations are more vulnerable to experiencing food insecurity?

What is the difference between overall food insecurity and child food insecurity?

What is the relationship between the cost per meal/annual food budge shortfall and food insecurity?

## Technical Description

__What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?__

For the format of our final project, we would like to construct a Shiny application.

Our project may include the following visuals:
- Interactive map of the United States in order to visually display the geography of food insecurity
- Interactive plot to exhibit the relationship, or correlation, between cost per meal/annual food budget shortfall and food insecurity

Additionally, our application will, in correspondence with our visuals, provide explanations that examine the factors that lead individuals to experience food insecurity, negative health outcomes related to food insecurity, and the populations are more vulnerable to experiencing food insecurity.

__Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?__

At first, we did have a difficult time collecting data; however, we were able to contact _Feeding America_ and received a data set that includes information about the food insecurity by the county of each state, child food insecurity, cost per meal, and the annual food budget shortfall.

Furthermore, we are not anticipating any data management challenges. The raw data has already been prepped and placed in the repository.

__What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?__

Our group, as a whole, seems to feel confident with the opportunity to construct a Shiny application. In addition, each member seems comfortable in their ability to use R and RStudio. With this being said, I do not see us needing to learn any new technical skills.

There is a chance, however, that we may need to refresh our memory about how to handle GIT merge conflicts, and general GIT collaboration procedures.

__What major challenges do you anticipate?__

One challenge we anticipate having is figuring out if we want to tackle one issue specifically or try and talk about all of them together, as there are many important issues that can be brought up here.

Food insecurity is such a major topic that covers a wide range of issues that it is important that our project establishes a good balance between comprehensiveness and specificity.
