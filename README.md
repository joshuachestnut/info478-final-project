# Food Insecurity in the United States

## Project Description

__What is the purpose of your research project?__

There are several relationships we can observe between food access, stress, chronic diseases and socioeconomic status. There are vulnerable populations such as low-income individuals who have limited access to low-cost and nutritious food which further contributes to the impediment of their health. Throughout our research we hope to discover which states are more prone to experiencing food insecurity in addition to examining the various factors that limit access to healthy foods.

__What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to include 3+ links to related works.__

Research in this area has primarily been in the area of welfare, relating food insecurity to the wealth/socioeconomic status of families. Other studies have been done explaining how food insecurity leads to worse nutrition overall, and how food insecurity as a child can lead to a problem in the future with that child’s “Workforce and Job Readiness.”

__What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.__

For this project, we are using dataset constructed by Feeding America. Feeding America is a nonprofit organization within the United States that has more than 200 food banks, and feeds more than 46 million people.

The food insecurity rates of the data set determined by “using data from the 2001-2017 Current Population Survey on individuals in food insecure households; data from the 2017 American Community Survey on median household incomes, poverty rates, homeownership, and race and ethnic demographics; and 2017 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on unemployment rate” (Map the Meal Gap 2019).

We collected the data by emailing Feeding America, and they sent us the complete data set.

__Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.__

Our target audience will be policy makers and government health workers who can influence decision making. Through our finding we hope to illustrate how vulnerable populations are affected by different factors and suggest solutions.

__What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)__

What factors lead individuals to experience food insecurity?

What are some of the negative health outcomes related to food insecurity?

Which populations are more vulnerable to experiencing food insecurity?

## Technical Description

__What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?__

For the format of our final project, we would like to construct a Shiny application. One component of the application will include a geographical map of the United States in order to visually display food insecurity.

__Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?__

We did have a difficult time collecting data; however, we were able to email Feeding America and received a data set that includes information about the food insecurity by each county of each state, child food insecurity, and cost per meal.

__What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?__

I do not see us needing to learn any new technical skills. I do believe we are going to need to refresh our memory about how to handle GIT merge conflicts and constructing a Shiny application.

__What major challenges do you anticipate?__

One challenge we anticipate us having is figuring out if we want to tackle one issue specifically or try and talk about all of them together, as there are many important issues that can be brought up here.
